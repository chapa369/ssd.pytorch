    - organize into folders

DATAAUGMENTATION dataaugmentation.py
getting data ready to go through the network

use pytorch image transforms
-   


To make the model more robust to various input object sizes and shapes, 
each training image is randomly sampled by one of the following options:
    – Use the entire original input image.
    – Sample a patch so that the minimum jaccard overlap with the objects is 0.1, 0.3,
    0.5, 0.7, or 0.9.
    – Randomly sample a patch.
